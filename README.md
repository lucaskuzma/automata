# Test

## Notes

Rule was represented as a string for pretty printing, but should probably just be a number from the start.

Ran out of time to even think about optimization.

Could use some more tests.

Normally I would use a virtual env, but ran out of time.

Should check input is even integers, etc., but ran out of time.
